## Overview
Rarely does a single technology take over the world in quite the way that integrated circuits (ICs) have done. From their invention around 60 years ago, ICs are now found in almost everything we do (computers, smart phones, wearables, robots). While in the past, the focus was on designing high performance general purpose processors, the industry is now moving towards more and more specialized ICs (called accelerators) such as graphics processing units (GPUs), deep learning accelerators and image and video processing accelerators. This move towards specialization is driven by the high performance and energy efficiency demands of sensor-rich smart phones, autonomous robots, and large data centers running applications such as image and video processing and analysis, graphics, speech processing, AI and machine learning. This course will teach you how to design such specialized ICs.

The course starts with a quick introduction to MOS transistors and IC fabrication and then creates abstractions to allow you to create and reason about complex digital systems. It uses a switch resistor model of a transistor, uses it to model gates, and then shows how gates and physical layout can be synthesized from Verilog or SystemVerilog descriptions. Most of the class will be spent on providing techniques to create designs that can be validated, are low power, provide good performance, and can be completed in finite time.

## Course learning goals
By taking this course, you will be able to:

1. Build combinational digital logic from transistors and wires and model and optimize its delay and power.
2. Build sequential logic using clocks and storage elements; understand the tradeoffs between different clocking methods.
3. Design a complex digital system by describing it in Verilog or SystemVerilog and use CAD tools to synthesize it into gates and physical layout.
4. Verify the system using testing and formal methods using CAD tools.
5. Measure the system's power, performance and area; build an intuition for tradeoff's between these and iterate on the design to optimize them.

## Prerequisites
EE 101A and EE 108  (or equivalents) are pre-requisites for this course. We are looking for familiarity with transistors, logic design, Verilog and digital system organization from these pre-requisite courses.

Please talk to us if you have any questions about prerequisites.
